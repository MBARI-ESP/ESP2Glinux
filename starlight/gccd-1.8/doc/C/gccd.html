<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction:</h2>
  The Gnome CCD Camera Imaging application, <b>gccd</b>, is a basic camera,&nbsp;
 telescope, and filter wheel controller.&nbsp; It is not meant to be an astronomical&nbsp;
 image processing application.&nbsp; However, over time it might start to 
include more and more image processing functions.&nbsp; In order to make the
best images, <b>gccd</b> can control telescope slewing and filter wheels for
color imaging.&nbsp; One-shot color cameras are supported by allowing the
full color frame to be split into individual color frames.&nbsp; More than
one CCD camera can be controlled to allow for guiding using one camera while
integrating on another.&nbsp; The Starlight Xpress MX series of cameras can
self-guide so that guiding and integration can occur on the same camera.&nbsp; 
Multiple exposures can be combined using a number of arithmetic operationsto 
create calibation frames.&nbsp; By enabling auto-registration, multiple short 
exposures can be added to simulate a longer single integration.&nbsp; The 
one-shot color cameras will split its colors before registration.

<h2><a name="Main_Image_View"></a>Main Image View:</h2>
  The main view of <b>gccd</b> is a MDI window that can display multiple
images&nbsp;  in either a single notebook view or multiple top level windows,
one foreach  image.&nbsp; Images are manipulated, opened, and stored from
the mainview.&nbsp;  
<h3><a name="Load_Image"></a>Load Image:</h3>
  FITS format is the only graphics files that can be accessed through <b>
gccd</b>  .&nbsp; Any FITS format file can be loaded.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Acquire_Image"></a>Acquire Image:</h3>
  Acquiring an image brings up the CCD control panel.&nbsp; Look in the Acquire&nbsp;
 Image Control section for a full description of this function.  
<h3><a name="Image_Properties"></a>Image Properties:</h3>
  Image properties are basically the FITS file header records.&nbsp; Some 
are static and cannot be edited.&nbsp; Others are fields used to identify 
the image and other pertinent information.&nbsp; The NAME field is the base 
filename without any directory path or extension.&nbsp; Use this to help identifythe
image with a glance.&nbsp; It must also be unique among the loaded images.&nbsp;
The static fields define the format and parameters of the exposure.  
<h3><a name="Save_Image"></a>Save Image:</h3>
  FITS format is the only graphics file format that images can be saved with.
 &nbsp; The default extension is .fits but this can be changed using 'Save
 As'. &nbsp; The FITS header can be edited with the '<a href="#Image_Properties">
  ImageProperties</a>' menu item.  
<h3><a name="Working_Directory"></a>Working Directory:</h3>
  The working directory is the default directory used to load and save images.
 &nbsp; It can be set through the Preferences drop-down menu.&nbsp; Once
set,  itis retained accross invocations.  
<h3><a name="COM_Port_Settings"></a>COM Port Settings:</h3>
  Both the telescope slewing control and the filter wheel control require 
access&nbsp; to a serial port.&nbsp; If 'None' is selected, that device will 
not be enabled&nbsp; in the CCD Control panel.&nbsp; Since <b>gccd </b>does 
not run with root priveledges, the serial port device files, /dev/ttyS*, need
to allow access to regular user applications.&nbsp; Use the <b>chmod</b> 
program to alter the priveledge access bits to the serial device files.  
<h3><a name="View_Multiple_Document_Interface"></a>View Multiple Document
 Interface Settings:</h3>
  The Gnome MDI window can be viewed in three diffent modes.&nbsp; Notebook,
 toplevel, and modal.&nbsp; Notebook and modal only display one image at
a  time in a single main window.&nbsp; The notebook view has tabs along oneside
 that can be clicked to bring any image to the front.&nbsp; Modal doesn't
have  tab settings but the 'Window' menu has the list of all images loadedand
can  be selected with the menu items.&nbsp; The toplevel view gives each
image its own window.&nbsp; This can display all the images at once, but
requires lots of screen real-estate.&nbsp; The default view mode is defined
in the Gnome  Control Panel.&nbsp; The view mode will remain persistent accross
invocations  once set, regardless of the Gnome Control Panel.  
<h3><a name="View_Image_Colorized"></a>View Image Colorized:</h3>
  One-shot color cameras and monochrome images taken through filters can
be&nbsp;  displayed using the color information recorded from the camera
and/or filter&nbsp;  wheel.&nbsp; The colorized image is only an aid in seeing
the color in the  image because it hasn't been calibrated.&nbsp; An image
processing program  is needed to adjust the color balance.  
<h3><a name="View_Image_Contrast_Stretched"></a>View Image Contrast Stretched:</h3>
  Many images don't use the full dynamic range of the DAC so they can be
very&nbsp;  dark.&nbsp; The contrast stretch setting simply does a linear
stretch of the  images' min and max values to the display.&nbsp; This does
not change the  image data in any way, it is simply a visual aid.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
   
<h3><a name="View_Image_Aspect_Corrected"></a>View Image Aspect Corrected:</h3>
  This displays the downloaded image with a 1:1 aspect ratio.&nbsp; The pixel
 size is used to adjust the displayed image.&nbsp; It does not affect theimage
 in memory or when it is saved.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Flip_Image"></a>Flip Image:</h3>
  An image can be flipped in the horizontal or verical direction.&nbsp; This
 in normally done to re-orient the image because of an optical path that
flips&nbsp;  the image.  
<h3><a name="Invert_Image"></a>Invert Image:</h3>
  An image can be inverted, basically making a negative of the original.&nbsp;
 Some astronomers find this a better way to view faint images.&nbsp; This 
can be done twice to restore the original image.  
<h3><a name="Remove_Background"></a>Remove Background:</h3>
  In the event of much light pollution or when taking stacked images through
 a regular SLR camera lens, there can be a lot of background accumulation.&nbsp;
 This option finds the most common pixel value (usually the background) and
 subtracts 95% of this value from the image.&nbsp; It removes most of the 
background contribution while leaving enough for faint features.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Remove_Noise"></a>Remove Noise:</h3>
  When using uncooled cameras or making a very long dark frame, unwanted
noise  can creep into the image.&nbsp; This option removes spurious pixel
values  while leaving most of the image untouched.&nbsp; Make sure to save
the image  before applying this option to make sure undersamples features
aren't removed  as noise.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Splitting_OneShot_Color_Frames_into"></a>Splitting One-ShotColor
 Frames into Individual Color Frames:</h3>
  One-shot color cameras achieve a full color image with a single integration&nbsp;
 because of a color matrix overlaying the pixel grid of the CCD.&nbsp; Individual&nbsp;
 color frames can be synthesized by analyzing the color matrix and copying&nbsp;
 the pixels of each unique color to a new frame.&nbsp; Colors that aren't
represented  because of the matrix ordering are created from an average of
their nearest  neighbors that match the color.&nbsp; The recombination of
the color frames  and their calibration is left to the image processing program.<br>
  <br>
   
<hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2">  
<h2><a name="Acquire_Image_Control"></a>Acquire Image Control:</h2>
  The Acquisition Control contains all the options for imaging.&nbsp; It
has  three main control areas.&nbsp; The main exposure options are available
at  the bottom of the panel.&nbsp; Exposure duration and camera selection
aswell  as status are always visible.&nbsp; On the right is the telescope
control  panel.&nbsp; It is always available for moving and slewing the telescope.&nbsp;
 Options for inverting the right ascension and declination can be set to
match  the image view.&nbsp; Finally, the notebook view contains all the
advanced  options for integration, guiding, and filter wheel control.  
<h3><a name="Select_Camera"></a>Select Camera:</h3>
  All identified cameras are avialable in a drop down list.&nbsp; The displayed&nbsp;
 camera is what will be used for integrating.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Exposure_Duration"></a>Exposure Duration:</h3>
  The exposure duration can be selected using three units: milliseconds,
seconds,&nbsp;  and minutes.&nbsp; This allows for integrations from instantaneous
to many  hours.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Exposure_BeginCancel"></a>Exposure Begin/Cancel:</h3>
  Exposures are started with the main Begin button at the bottom of the panel.
 &nbsp; Once the integration begins, the button label changes to Cancel.&nbsp;
 The button can be pressed again to abort the exposure.&nbsp; If the <a href="#Find__Focus">
  Find &amp;Focus</a>panel is active, the integrated frame will be sent tothe
 find/focus window instead of being saved.<br>
   
<hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2">  
<h3><a name="Exposure_Option"></a>Exposure Option:</h3>
  Options for the integrated image <br>
   
<h4><a name="Binning"></a>Binning:</h4>
  The image can be binned vertically and/or horizontally at 1X, 2X and 4X.&nbsp;
 Depending on the camera, the binning will occur inside the CCD chip or digitally&nbsp;
 as the image is read.&nbsp; One special bin mode for thevertical direction
 is the 1/2 X bin.&nbsp; This is a bin mode for the StartlightXpress MX series
 of cameras that use the Sony interline CCDs.&nbsp; This mode reads out the
 even and odd fields seperately and interleaves them for double the vertical
 resolution.&nbsp; All other cameras treat the 1/2 X bin identically to 1X
bin.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Calibration"></a>Calibration:</h4>
  Calibration can be carried out using bias, dark, and flat frames.&nbsp; 
Bias frames are zero length integrations used to subtract out DC bias and 
read noise.&nbsp; A standard dark frame, one that includes bias and has the 
same exposure time as the selected integration can be used in the bias frame 
option. &nbsp; Scaled dark frames can be used as generic darks.&nbsp; They 
should be exposed&nbsp; for a least twice as long as the intended calibrated 
integration. Flatfields are used to counteract effects of dust in the optical 
path and vignetting.&nbsp; If using the <a href="#Flat_Field">filter wheel 
flat field</a>, this option should be left as (None) otherwise it will override 
the filterflat field.  
<h4><a name="Base_Name__Number_"></a>Base Name &amp; Number:</h4>
  The base name and starting sequence number of acquired images can be sethere.&nbsp;
 If you are going to shoot a sequence of images of M42, you mightenter M42
 as the base, and 1 for the starting sequence number.&nbsp; Thesequence number
 will increment after every exposure to keep the image names unique.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Multiple_Exposures"></a>Multiple Exposures:</h4>
  Many back to back integrations can be made for various reasons.&nbsp; The
 images can be individually sent to the <a href="#Main_Image_View">Main View</a>
  for capturing good seeing for planetary images&nbsp; or combined to improve
 a deep sky image.<br>
   
<h5><a name="Frame_Combine_Modes"></a>Frame Combine Modes:</h5>
  The combine modes allow most common arithmatic frame combinations.&nbsp; 
Summing,&nbsp; averaging, median, minimum, and maximum operations are supported.<br>
   
<h5><a name="AutoRegistration"></a>Auto-Registration:</h5>
  The individual frames can be registered to the first image frame so all 
the&nbsp; exposed frames can be combined.&nbsp; If frames are kept seperate, 
theywill still be registered before being sent to the <a href="#Main_Image_View">
 Main View</a>.&nbsp; When registering with a one-shot color camera, the
combined  color frame will be split into individual color frames before the
registration  takes place.&nbsp; This keeps the color matrix information
from being corrupted  since registration will shift each frame by a sub-pixel
amounts.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Find__Focus"></a>Find &amp;Focus:</h3>
  Achieving good focus is actually harder than it should be.&nbsp; To help,
 the Find &amp;Focus pane tries to make image downloads as short as possible&nbsp;
 so the image frame rate allows real-time focus control.&nbsp; The same features&nbsp;
 make locating and centering objects easer as well.&nbsp; Some cameras can
 also reduce the DAC precision to improve download time as well.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Image_Scale"></a>Image Scale:</h4>
  By using the binning and windowing features of the CCD camera, the integrated&nbsp;
 image can be quickly downloaded.&nbsp; The image scale can be set from 4:1
 to 1:4.&nbsp; Zooming out to 4:1 uses binning to reduce download time and
 increase camera sensitivity.&nbsp; This scale helps achieve gross focus.&nbsp;
 By moving to the next scale level and adjusting focus along the way, good
 focus can be quickly achieved.&nbsp; The focus image will be contrast stretched
 to help find the sharpest image.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Image_Histogram"></a>Image Histogram:</h4>
  The histogram of the image will help identify when best focus is achieved.
 &nbsp; Minimum and maximum pixel values can be used as a focus quality measurement.
 &nbsp; Because the focus pane automatically applies a contrast stretch,
it  cannot&nbsp; be used to measure the relative brightness of the image.&nbsp;
 Use the histogram&nbsp; for quantitative focus feedback. <br>
   
<h3><a name="Guide"></a>Guide:</h3>
  Guiding is used for improving the tracking of your telescope.&nbsp; Normally
 this is applied in conjunction with a telescope interface to make real-time
 adjustments during an exposure.&nbsp; A seperate camera is required for
the  guiding unless you have one of the Starlight Xpress MX series of cameras.&nbsp;
 These cameras have the ability to expose one field (odd or even) while guiding
 with the other.&nbsp; <b>GCCD</b> was designed with this feature in mind.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Select_Guide_Camera"></a>Select Guide Camera:</h4>
  This is the camera to be used for guiding.&nbsp; Unless you have a Starlight
 Xpress MX series camera, it cannot be the same as the exposing camera.&nbsp;
 One special note:&nbsp; If you only want to autoguide for regular astrophotography
 or to just keep a star centered for visual tracking and you have only one
 CCD camera, load the dummy CCD camera <b>tester</b>.&nbsp; Set your real
camera  for guiding and <b>tester</b> for integrating.&nbsp; Set the exposurefor
as long as you want.&nbsp; You will not get a real image, of course,but the
CCD camera will guide the telescope for you.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Self_Guide_Fields"></a>Self Guide Fields:</h4>
  For use with the Starlight Xpress MX series of cameras.&nbsp; Lets you
select  how to merge the even/odd fields of the CCD after guiding.&nbsp;
The last  option, "Ignore Errors", is used for taking dark frames.&nbsp;
Normally the  guiding algorithm will issue errors if it loses the guide star.&nbsp;
This  skips the errors and continues with the integration.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Select_Guide_Object"></a>Select Guide Object:</h4>
  This allows for manual selection of a guiding object.&nbsp; Usually you 
can let the software choose the brightest object, but this might not be desireable
 for tracking comets and other non-star objects.&nbsp; You also need to manually
 select a guide object before <a href="#Train_Tracking">training</a>.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Clear_Guide_Object"></a>Clear Guide Object:</h4>
  Use this if you manually move the scope to a different location.&nbsp;
If  you move the scope through the scope control panel, the guide object
will  be automatically cleared.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Tracking_Rates"></a>Tracking Rates:</h4>
  These are the rates the tracking routine uses to move the telescope to
keep  the guide object centered.&nbsp; Usually they are automatically calibrated
 through <a href="#Train_Tracking">training</a> although they can be manually
 altered.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Train_Tracking"></a>Train Tracking:</h4>
  This is how the tracking rates are calibrated.&nbsp; You must <a href="#Select_Guide_Object">
  select</a> a bright guide object that is fairly isolated before training.&nbsp;
 The guide object should be close to the object you plan on imaging.&nbsp;
 Tracking rates can be dependent upon where in the sky the telescope is pointing.&nbsp;
 You may need to retrain if the telescope is slewed a great deal.&nbsp; If
 you get a message saying the guide star was lost while training, adjust
the  training duration <a href="#Miscellaneous_Values">here</a>.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Filter_Wheel"></a>Filter Wheel:</h3>
  The filter wheel is used for color imaging.&nbsp; Its use is fully integrated
 into the exposure process.&nbsp; By selecting the "Auto-Sequence" option,
 all subsequent exposures will cycle through the included filters.&nbsp;
All  exposures, including multiple, stacked, and otherwise will be shot through
 one filter before moving to the next filter where all the exposures will
be repeated.&nbsp; By selecting a current filter without "Auto-Sequence",
all exposures will be shot through the current filter only.&nbsp; Many filter
 wheels have a blank filter slot used for dark fields.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Color_Selection"></a>Color Selection:</h4>
  The color selection allows for the proper processing of the exposed image
 to take place.&nbsp; Color infromation is saved in the image and in the
image  name to help maintian records of the exposure.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Sequence_Inclusion"></a>Sequence Inclusion:</h4>
  Only filters selected for sequence inclusion will be imaged through when
 "Auto-Sequence" is selected.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Exposure_Percentage"></a>Exposure Percentage:</h4>
  When auto-sequencing, some filter/CCD combinations may be more sensitive
 than others.&nbsp; This setting allows for longer or shorter exposures through
 different filters.&nbsp; The percentage is multiplied by the global exposure
 duration to calculate the filtered exposure length.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Flat_Field"></a>Flat Field:</h4>
  Each filter should have its own flat field.&nbsp; In order to select a
flat  field for each filter, make sure the "Flat Field" option in the <a href="#Calibration">
  exposure options</a> is set to "(None)", otherwise it will override the 
filter flat field.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Miscellaneous_Values"></a>Miscellaneous Values:</h3>
  These are values used internally to many of the algorithms in <b>gccd</b>
  .&nbsp; Most will never need to be modified, but in case the algorithms 
fail, changing some of these values can get it to work for you situation.&nbsp;
 Usually the field of view affects the algorithms more than anything.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Telescope_Control"></a>Telescope Control:</h3>
  Controlling the telescope is required for the auto-guiding feature to work
 properly.&nbsp; The telescope control can be controlled through the internal
 routines of <b>gccd</b> or through mouse clicking on the arrows in the panel.
 &nbsp; The arrows always reflect the state of the telescope control.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Slewing"></a>Slewing:</h4>
  Slewing is useful for quickly moving the telescope.&nbsp; Using the STAR2000
 interface, slewing is done through moving in the desired direction, and
then  selecting the reverse direction as well.&nbsp; This is a feature of
the telescope  mount and not of <b>gccd</b>.&nbsp; It is known to work with
Losmandy mounts,  no others have been tested.&nbsp; If slewing with STAR2000
causes you telescope  to behave erratically, then this slewing control won't
work for you.&nbsp;  Also, slewing is enabled globally, meaning if you are
going to auto-guide  and have slewing selected, you will quickly lose the
guide star.&nbsp; <b>  Make sure slewing is disabled whenever using the guide
features, including  training!</b><br>
   
<h4><a name="Reversing_Directions"></a>Reversing&nbsp; Directions:</h4>
  If you have an inverted CCD image, or you flip your scope while crossing
 the meridian, you may need to reverse the directions on one or both of the
 controls.<br>
   
<h4><a name="Select_Interface"></a>Select Interface:</h4>
  Currently only LX200 style serial interfaces and STAR2000 style auto-guider
 interfaces are supported.&nbsp; The manual option doesn't connect to any
interface.&nbsp; However the arrows remain active.&nbsp; If you are diligent,
you can mimic the arrows while auto-guiding.&nbsp; You, in effect, become
the interface.&nbsp; The LX200 doesn't currently support any GOTO functionality.<br>

<h2><a name="Usage"></a>Usage:</h2>
  There are a few tips I've vome up while using and greating <b>gccd</b>.<br>
   
<h3><a name="Creating_Calibration_Frames"></a>Creating Calibration Frames:</h3>
  Calibration frames are important, but a real pain to incorporate into a 
busy imaging session.&nbsp; The best way to handle calibration frames is to
create a library of frames that you can use instead of creating ones every 
imaging session.&nbsp; Once the camera has stablized thermally, bias frames 
and scaled dark frames can be created and saved away.&nbsp; Whenever the temperature
changes by a few degrees however, the scaled dark frames won't match.&nbsp;
Make scaled dark frames at a variety of temperatures and save them in your
library.&nbsp; Flat fields can be created and saved for later assuming you
don't change the optical configuration in any way.&nbsp; The most important
scaled dark frame is for the self-guided Starlight Xpress MX cameras.&nbsp;
Because the amplifier is turned on frequently to read out the guide image,
a glow in the upper left hand corner results.&nbsp; I create a master dark
frame by creating a meridian combination of 5 - 30 minute exposures.&nbsp;
 In order to get the auto-guiding control defeated, select the "Ignore Errors"
 option in the <a href="#Self_Guide_Fields">Self-Guide</a> pane.&nbsp; This
 takes a long time - the perfect exercise on a cloudy night.&nbsp; Make sure
 your scaled darks are bias subtracted. Flat fields can be selected in the
 Exposure <a href="#Exposure_Option">Options</a> pane, or if you are using
 a filter wheel, each filter can have its own <a href="#Flat_Field">flat
field</a>  .<br>
   
<h3><a name="Using_Mutltiple_Cameras"></a>Using Mutltiple Cameras:</h3>
  Multiple cameras are supported.&nbsp; This allows for simultaneous auto-guiding
 and exposing with only one computer.<br>
   
<hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2">  
<h2><a name="Supported_Devices"></a>Supported Devices:</h2>
  Currently, CCD cameras use the CCD kernel drivers available in a seperate
 package.&nbsp; Any CCD camera supported with one of these drivers is available
 to <b>gccd</b>.&nbsp; The TrueTech Custom Filter Wheel is directly supported.&nbsp;
 I understand it uses the same command set as the SBIG filter wheel, so it
 might also work.&nbsp; The Starlight Xpress STAR2000 auto-guider interface
 is supported.&nbsp; You don't need a Starlight Xpress camera to use this
interface, it just connects to the auto-guider port on most telescope mounts.&nbsp;
The LX200 command set is supported but has only been tested on the Losmandy
Gemini system. &nbsp;Should work fine on all LX200 comatibles.<br>
