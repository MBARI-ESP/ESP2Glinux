The ESP low-power CPU usually boots from either its
256MB internal flash memory or a micro SD card. By convention,
The rootfs is mounted on the same storage device from which
the Linux kernel is loaded.

It is also possible to mount the ESP's root filesystem via NFS,
but this document will not describe NFS mounts.

Usually ESPs are deployed booting from internal flash with the SD card utilized
as storage for all deployment data.  However, ESPs in an environment where
they will be frequenty rebooted, ESPs are deployed booting from their
SD cards to minimize startup time.

Advantages to choosing to boot from the SD card are:

1)  Works for CPU cards with corrupt or unitialized internal flash memory!
2)  Faster boot time (kernel loads in 1 second verses 15 seconds)
3)  Much larger rootfs size  (up to 128GB vs 250MB)
4)  Higher read and (especially) write speeds

Due to item #1 above, always configure new boards with boot jumpers
set to load U-Boot from the SD card.

Advantages of booting from the internal flash are:

1)  Higher reliability
2)  SD card may be physically removed to recover data from a damaged CPU board
3)  Ability to boot without an any SD card installed

Most SD cards are waterproof.  The CPU board is not!


The clone script copies the rootfs and boot system files from
internal flash to the SD card or vice versa.  It can be used to:

1)  Initialize the internal flash of a new CPU board,
2)  Clone the internal flash to an SD card, making it bootable,
      [This effectively creates a backup of the internal flash]
3)  Clone an SD card over a corrupted internal flash, restoring it.
      [Only the software is restored.  Any deployment data is lost.]

Cloning completely overwrites the destination device.
Therefore, the clone destination device must not be in use.
It is not possible clone to the SD card if there are files currently opened on
it.  When booting form internal flash, the system will use any installed
SD card for storing data and system swap space.  So, one must boot the ESP
without an SD card installed to allow cloning to one.
Clone destination SD cards may be (re-)insered anytime after the
initial logon prompt is issued.

SD cards must be specially formatted for use in the ESP.
This one time formatting may be done on another computer if desired,
but it usually most convenient to format the SD card on an ESP.
[provided it was booted it internal SPI flash]

The procedure for formating an ESP compatible SD card is:

   Install the SD card

 (the cfdisk utility works better if run from a network login
  rather than using the serial console)

# cfdisk  -z  /dev/mmcblk0   #the -z says to ignore whatever was on the SD card

You need to create three primary partitions of the indicated types
 and sizes below:

   Name      Flags    Part TypeFS Type        [Label]     Size (MB)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
   mmcblk0p1           Primary W95 FAT32 (LBA)               100.00
   mmcblk0p3           Primary BootIt                          0.37
   mmcblk0p2           Primary Linux                  (rest of disk)

The sizes are not critical.  The first partition stores the Linux
kernel and (optionally) the compressed factory image of the root filesystem.
It should be >30MB.  I usually allocate 100MB for this.
If the factory image is omitted, it may be made as small as 4MB.
The p3 partition (of type 'BootIt') holds the U-Boot boot loader.
It must be physically before the big Linux parition.
You create the p1 parition first, then the Linux p2 partition.
Specify a size for the Linux partition that is about 0.5 MB less than
the maximum remaining available space for it.  When prompted whether
to allocate this big partition at the begin or end of the free space,
indicate you want it at the end.
This will leave you a ~0.5MB free hole remaining just after the FAT32
partition.  The BootIt partition's minimum size is 0.3MB.

 The hexidecimal type of the FAT32(LBA) parition is 0C  (12 decimal)
 The hexidecimal type of the Linux parition is 83
 The hexidecimal type of the BootIt parition is DF

Once you have the table looking correct in cfdisk, write it to out to disk
with the W command, then quit cfdisk.
The formated SD card is now ready for the clone command to use as a destination.


===============================================================================

Clone command usage:

  clone {--factory} {--to destination} {source}

Optional Flags:
  --factory:
      Clone the factory recovery image
      (this is equivalent specifying source archive /boot/rootfs.tgz)

  --to destination  #specifies clone output destination where:
      SD|card outputs to the SD card
      flash   outputs to internal flash memory
      /*      outputs tar archive to file at specified absolute path
      -       outputs tar archive to stdout

  --help  #display this

Optional source argument:
      Read the root filesystem image from the specified directory or
      (compressed) tar archive
      If source is -, read archive from stdin
      If omitted, source defaults to the current rootfs  (i.e. / )

Environment Variables:
  TARFLAGS[=-zv]
      overrides the default arguments to tar in reading or writing archives

Notes:
  If --to is not specified, the destination is assumed to be the storage medium
  that is currently NOT in use.  In practice, this means...
  If rootfs is the SD card, destination is internal flash and visaversa.

  The --factory flag and source argument are mutually exclusive

Examples:
  clone
    #Without args: clones current root filesystem to unused storage medium
    #If booted from flash, creates a bootable SD card.
    #If booted from SD, writes a bootable image to the internal flash.

  clone --factory
    #As above, but writes the "pristine" factory image instead

  clone /template
    #Clone the root filesystem at /template, making it bootable

  clone --to /boot/rootfs.tgz
    #Overwrite the factory image with a copy of current rootfs

  clone --to /boot/rootfs.tgz  /template
    #Overwrite the factory image with a copy of filesystem rooted at /template
